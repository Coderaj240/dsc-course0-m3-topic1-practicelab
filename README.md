# Practice Lab for Types of Data

You are given a record of dogs that have visited a small vet clinic in the past few hours. The clinic is currently very busy. There is a new virus that turns some dogs (who are usually by default all good boys and girls) into bad doggies. Also a very nasty doggy flu has been going around at the same time. 

* Given the situation, data entry has been rushed and there are some inconsistencies that need to be addressed and type conversion you will need to do to get the data into your organization's standard. 
* Your direct manager (who is not a data person) is European and wants the dog length to be converted to metric because he thinks that the inch is a preposterous unit of measurement.
* The head veterinarian wants a flagging system for dogs that come in running a fever.


You, the only data analyst at this small clinic, have been assigned these tasks. Exercise your knowledge of string cleaning, mathematical operations on numeric quantities, and booleans in order to complete the work.
